Title: CCNMF: A Coupled-Clone Nonnegative Matrix Factorization Method for Integrating Tumor Single-Cell RNA and DNA Sequencing Data
Version: 2.2.0

Description: CCNMF joinly cluster the single-cell RNA-seq and single-cell DNA-seq from the same cancer by NMF. Then the ientified clones of copy number varients in scDNA-seq can be corresoponded to the subpopulations of gene expression in scRNA-seq.
